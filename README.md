# webdriver

A simple implementation of the pretty recent [W3C WebDriver spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/).

I have coded this library during a livestream, if you want to learn more about it's internals and how it can be used take a look:

## Examples

I have prepared an example repo showing how to test a sample Jester app using Travis with this library, available here: https://github.com/dom96/geckodriver-travis.

For a larger example you can have a look at the Nimforum: https://github.com/nim-lang/nimforum/tree/master/tests
